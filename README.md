Projects:

Title Screen

Description: For the game “Title Screen” I incorporated a variety of elements often associated with platformer puzzle games. These mechanics include walking, jumping, picking up items, dropping items, and the ability to click on certain buttons and objects. The player character can pick up items by walking over them. These items are used in a variety of ways to progress through the game. One such item is the screwdriver, which is used to unscrew certain letters in the credits area. The primary antagonist of the game, dubbed the “Katamogiri,” steals the players items, forcing them to consider other approaches to completing the game. Another mechanic we incorporated was the ability to swap between different screens in the game, such as the options and credits screen.
Technologies Used: Construct 3, Audacity, Photoshop, Paint.net, Fontforge

Ninja Trilogy

Description: I created a closed community Naruto game on the ROBLOX platform that I never released to the public. I made it a permanent death game where if you die you lose most of your progress. It has weeks worth of time put in as the character has to progress the game through missions, and killing other players. When leveling up the player gets skill points that they can put into the skill tree. There are multiple game mechanics such as throwing kunai, fighting/air combat, wall climbing, tree jumping, parkour, a death system, and more.
